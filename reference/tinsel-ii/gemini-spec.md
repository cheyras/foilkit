Implementation-grade spec for the "Tinsel II" holofoil pattern, from the frames of the 14:02-15:12 chapter and the narration over them.

## Cards Shown
*   **Basic Metal Energy** (Sword & Shield era, likely a special set or promo given the full-face foil): Visible in frames 1, 2, and 3.
*   **Groudon** (Sword & Shield era, visible attacks include "Earthquake"): Visible in frames 6, 7, and 8 being rubbed with acetone to reveal the raw foil underneath.
*   *Note: Frames 4 and 5 show the creator talking and are excluded from the foil analysis.*

## Static Appearance
The foil pattern consists of dense, horizontal lines that cover the entire face of the card, including the borders. The lines are not uniform; they vary significantly in thickness and darkness, creating a textured, somewhat chaotic look that the creator describes as "static" or a "fireworks effect." The foil reflects a full spectrum of rainbow colors depending on the light angle. The pattern exists in the background behind the main subject (the energy symbol) and extends fully to the edges.

## Tilt Animation
Between frame 1 and frame 3, as the card is tilted slightly, a broad, diffuse band of light moves across the surface. 
*   The underlying horizontal line structure remains completely stationary.
*   The colors reflecting off the lines shift smoothly through a rainbow gradient (hue rotation) as the angle changes.
*   Different segments of the horizontal lines brighten and dim as the specular highlight passes over them, emphasizing the irregular thickness of the lines. There are no discrete shapes (like stars or orbs) that pop in or out; the animation is a smooth sheen moving over a static, textured surface.

## Layer Structure Hypothesis
The physical construction consists of two primary layers:
1.  **Base Foil Layer:** A metallic foil layer embossed or etched with the irregular horizontal line pattern. This layer is responsible for the rainbow diffraction.
2.  **Printed Ink Layer:** Standard CMYK ink printed over the foil. As demonstrated in frames 6-8, the ink can be dissolved with acetone to reveal the raw foil underneath. The borders lack an opaque white underlayer, allowing the foil to shine through brightly, while areas like the text box and the central energy symbol are printed over opaque white to block the foil effect.

## Distinguishing Features
This pattern is easily distinguished by its dense, horizontal, irregular lines. It looks like TV static stretched horizontally or heavily brushed metal. It differs from the "original tinsel" by being darker and having more variance in line thickness. It is distinct from dot-based, star-based, or smooth sheen patterns because of its strong, chaotic horizontal grain.

## Shader Notes
*   **Base Texture:** Generate a high-frequency 1D noise texture (or a 2D noise heavily scaled along the Y-axis) to create the irregular horizontal lines.
*   **Line Variance:** Map the noise values to control both the opacity/darkness of the lines and slightly perturb the surface normal to simulate the "thickness" variance.
*   **Tilt Uniform:** Use a `viewDir` or `tilt` uniform to calculate a specular reflection vector.
*   **Color Ramp:** Use the dot product of the reflection vector and the light direction to sample a 1D rainbow color ramp.
*   **Masking:** Require a mask texture to define where the foil is visible (borders, background) versus where it is blocked by opaque ink (text, symbols).
*   **Blend:** Multiply the rainbow specular highlight by the horizontal noise texture to ensure the light catches the "static" lines appropriately.

## Confidence
*   **Cards Shown:** High. The names are clearly legible.
*   **Static Appearance:** High. The horizontal line structure is very clear in the close-ups.
*   **Tilt Animation:** Medium. Only three frames show the tilt, but the behavior of the light moving over the static lines is standard for this type of foil.
*   **Layer Structure Hypothesis:** High. The acetone demonstration explicitly confirms the ink-over-foil structure.
*   **Distinguishing Features:** High. The visual texture is distinct and explicitly described in the narration.
*   **Shader Notes:** High. The visual effect maps cleanly to standard noise and specular shading techniques.
