// foil/patterns.ts — the pattern library: the FULL 43-type holofoil taxonomy
// (docs/TAXONOMY.md — canonical: the 39 video types + the §40–43
// vocabulary extensions, reconciled from the Sleeve No Card Behind video +
// Bulbapedia + the vision pass), each type rendered by one of
// the implemented shader recipes. Types whose physical process has a faithful
// recipe are `implemented: true`; every other type renders via its NEAREST
// implemented recipe and says so (`approxVia`) — taxonomy leads, honest
// fallback labeling follows. Adding a real recipe = writing its GLSL and
// flipping the types it faithfully models to implemented.
//
// Each recipe supplies a GLSL function body:
//   vec3 foilPattern(vec2 uv, vec2 tilt)
// uv is card UV (0..1, y UP), tilt is uTilt (-1..1). The function may read
// any core uniform (uScale, uHueShift, uHueSpread, uTime) plus the
// per-pattern params uP0..uP5 — sliders in the workbench take their label,
// range, and default from `params`. Return value is the foil light layer
// (linear-ish RGB, 0..~1.5), later masked, gained by uIntensity, and
// screen-blended over the scan by the shared fragment main().
//
// Implemented recipe families:
//   starlight    — parallax star layers (#1 Starlight; #24 Starlight II at parallax 0)
//   cosmos       — staggered disc "bubbles" (#2 Cosmos; coarse for #15/#16)
//   sheen        — linear-grating band foil, ONE generator at four rotations +
//                  an optional stripe texture (#14 vertical, #21 horizontal =
//                  the TRUE SV default, #19/#20 diagonals, #22 striped/Line).
//                  docs/TAXONOMY.md: the sheen family is one physical

//   cracked-ice  — voronoi facet activation (#9; machinery seeds glitter/facet types)

// ── R6 composite families (2026-08-07) ──────────────────────────────────────
// Re-derived from Chey's FOUR hand-tuned canons, which are the only real
// evidence we have about how these dials should land on a card. He asked for
// exactly this: "i re-adjusted cracked-ice. take a look at it, and then make
// the changes based on everything you're observing to make all of this better —
// i want it so that i have to do as little of work personally on all the rest
// as possible."
//
// What his canons say (mirror runs the METAL law and is excluded — it is its
// own thing and its own canon):
//
//   uSheenTint  0 on ALL THREE non-mirror canons (cracked-ice, tinsel-ii,
//               rainbow-glitter-sheen). The R5b family defaults were 0.15 /
//               0.5 / 0.85 / 0.6 — every one of them too high. Tinting a
//               pattern's highlight with the ink underneath IS the thing he
//               rejected: "it adds no rainbow color or anything to the card."
//               So the composite families now declare 0, and a recipe that
//               genuinely wants art-coloured metal says so with its own uTint
//               (that path is untouched: tintW = uTint when uSheenTint is 0).
//
//   uSheen      he raised every one: 1.6 -> 3 (cracked-ice), 1.6 -> 3
//               (tinsel-ii), 1.0 -> 1.4 (rainbow-glitter-sheen). Shipped
//               defaults were far too quiet on a real scan.
//
//   uDepth      NOT universal. cracked-ice 0, tinsel-ii 1, rgs 1. The dial
//               darkens the card exactly WHERE THE PATTERN IS NOT (darkHalf
//               follows pattern luminance), so what it costs depends on how
//               much of the face the pattern's light actually covers.
//
// Measured (tools/duty — pattern light over the black canon base, every
// substrate/gloss dial neutralised, mean of three tilts) the coverage of each
// recipe's own light, and his three choices line up with it:
//
//   recipe                 duty>0.15   his uSheen   his uDepth
//   cracked-ice               12.8%        3.0          0
//   tinsel-ii                 26.5%        3.0          1
//   rainbow-glitter-sheen     63.7%        1.4          1
//
// Sparse light wants GAIN and no substrate (the ground between flashes is
// cardstock, not foil). Dense light wants less gain and a real substrate (the
// ground between highlights IS foil, and foil is darker than paper — that
// contrast is what makes a sheet read as a sheet). The three tiers below are
// that relationship; per-recipe overrides then take over, tuned by eye on the
// recipe's own assigned cards.
//
// All five dials here are SCAN-PATH ONLY: on a blank canon base the ink
// estimates are exactly 0 by construction, so uScanBase 0 skips the branch and
// no saved canon changes appearance at any value. Proven, not assumed — AE 0
// across all 44 implemented recipes x 4 canon tones x 3 tilts.

// R0 re-tune 2026-08-02 (Chey's ruling: chase Gemini's notes INTO the
// parallax rework, don't revert it). The 3-layer opposing-parallax
// architecture + glyph/blur population mix are untouched; what changed:
// tighter visibility lobe (pow 5 -> 9, floor 0.18 -> 0.08) so stars POP with
// a narrow activation window instead of breathing lazily; sharper glyph
// cores + narrower flare arms; blobs shrunk so even soft stars stay small;
// star color much more saturated (mix toward hueRamp 0.4 -> 0.72+); the
// galaxy wash default halved — the reference field is near-black between
// stars, the wash was reading as a continuous pastel noise field.

// axis-SPLIT tilt response + top-to-bottom hue banding, on top of the intact

//     depth separation on top of it;
//   - HORIZONTAL tilt = stars "fade in and out in a random way" — the
//     per-star visibility phase is driven by tilt.x, barely by tilt.y;
//   - star hue is BANDED down the card ("a banding of hues that go from the
//     top of the card to the bottom"): soft-quantized bands over uv.y. With
//     his canon uHueShift/uHueSpread (0.62/0.6) the bands run blue (top) →

/**
 * The sheen family — ONE generator, rotated per slug. Per the research the
 * physical product is the same linear-grating sheet mounted at four
 * rotations; `nrm` is the band NORMAL (the direction the bands travel) in
 * aspect-corrected card space, and the band sweep is driven by the component
 * of tilt along that normal.
 *
 * R3 rework (2026-08-02, Chey's canon-lab critique 6cbxdt / tzappu / octrck /
 * z7s2ng / epgakd — his eye is ground truth): the old model was an infinite
 * parallel grating; the real sheet reads as individual STREAKS —
 *   (a) sparser + irregularly spaced (per-streak existence/width/offset),
 *   (b) NOT always parallel or flush to the card edges: each streak carries
 *       its own lean, leans FOLLOW card tilt, and two interleaved layers with
 *       opposite lean bias crisscross; a streak that shears out of its
 *       grating cell simply ENDS — converging pairs "come to a point where
 *       they meet and don't continue" (his words),
 *   (c) finite length with tapered ends — Chey's "really stretched out
 *       ellipse" — via a per-streak envelope along the band axis,
 *   (d) hue banding on BOTH axes: hue advances ALONG each strip as well as
 *       across strips — "each one is a different rainbow line".
 * Uniform semantics unchanged (uP0 band count, uP1 drift, uP2 wobble, uP3
 * gain; canon files carry over — mean spacing is still uP0 * uScale).
 *
 * `stripes` = the SWSH "Line" foil, rebuilt R3 as its own body (fan grating +
 * grouped activation windows — see STRIPED note below).

// #3 Fireworks — dense field of dandelion-like radial ray bursts covering the
// FULL face (verified: bursts continue over the art). Bursts are static.
// R3-MISC rework 2026-08-03 (Chey j8zhas): (a) "the little bursts of
// fireworks are more consistently grid based" — ONE burst lattice with tiny
// jitter (uP2, canon 0 = perfect grid) replaces the two overlapping jittered
// octaves; (b) "the hue shift seems to sort of emanate from within the
// center of the burst going either in[ward] or outward, depending on the
// direction the card's being tilted" — hue is a function of RADIUS inside
// each burst, and the radial hue phase travels with the tilt sweep, so the
// spectral rings breathe out of (or into) every burst center as the card
// moves; direction flips with tilt sign for free.

// entirely off ... it's really just like the mirror one except that the
// spotlight that's on it has kind of a hue shift to it. Not that the
// spotlight is one single color that shifts, but that it has like hue
// banding to it as well"). SUPERSEDES the R2 blotch-field reading. The
// recipe is the MIRROR machinery — dark wavy environment reflection + one
// broad specular lobe traveling with tilt — but the lobe carries concentric
// spectral BANDS (radial hue rings, wobbled by the sheet waviness so they
// stay organic) whose phase travels with tilt, so colors migrate through
// the moving spotlight. Crystal Energy frame-05 confirms: magenta/green/
// yellow bands INSIDE the lit region, dark gray mirror outside it.
// R7 2026-08-08 — Chey rvbl2y, third pass and the first that reads his words
// literally: "This one is still pretty fundamentally wrong. The spotlight and
// the sheen should be banded blue -> green -> red from left to right, fairly
// vivid." Both earlier readings put the colour in a RADIAL coordinate (R2
// blotch field, R3 concentric rings inside the lobe) — the Crystal Energy
// reference frame-03 is unambiguous: violet/blue at the LEFT edge, green
// through the middle, orange/red at the RIGHT, across the whole face, with the
// travelling spotlight riding on top of that fixed spectral axis. So:
//   * the hue coordinate is card X (plus a waviness wobble so the band edges
//     stay organic, and a slow slide with tilt so the spectrum breathes),
//   * BOTH light features carry it — the broad sheen wash AND the spotlight,
//   * only the very core of the spotlight whitens (the R3 core-whitening was
//     eating the vividness he is asking for).
// Hue direction: hueRamp's cosine peaks are R(t=0) → B(1/3) → G(2/3), so the
// defaults uHueShift 1/3 + uHueSpread 2/3 put blue at the left edge, green mid,
// red at the right — exactly his order. The sliders keep their meanings.
