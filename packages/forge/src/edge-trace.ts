// foil/edge-trace.ts — the ARTWORK holds the geometry; his mask says which of it to follow.
//
// Chey, 2026-08-08, after reviewing the line-snap result: "I made changes to the
// tropius mask. Really just 'straighten' isn't quite enough, really just
// detecting edges and actually tracing accurately around them is the real move."
//
// THE PREMISE SHIFT. `line-snap@1` treated his strokes as the geometry and
// nudged near-straight runs onto printed lines where the evidence was strong,
// leaving everything else exactly as drawn. That frame is wrong. His mask is a
// STATEMENT OF INTENT — which regions of the card should carry foil. The
// ARTWORK holds the true geometry. So the output boundary is DERIVED FROM THE
// CARD'S OWN EDGES, traced accurately, with his mask used only to decide WHICH
// edge to follow and which side is inside. Curves, rounded corners, tag ends and
// panel fillets are first-class: they are the cases line-snap could not do at
// all, because a line fit cannot represent them.
//
// THE METHOD — livewire (intelligent scissors) over an edge-cost graph:
//
//   1. EDGE MAP        Di Zenzo colour structure tensor (a green→silver card
//                      boundary is a big CHROMA step and a small luminance one,
//                      so a luminance Sobel under-reads it) → non-maximum
//                      suppression → hysteresis linking. Canny-shaped, colour-aware.
//   2. CORRIDOR        A distance+index field around HIS boundary. Nothing
//                      outside `corridorPx` is reachable: the trace can crisp
//                      his line, never relocate it. His intent is a hard bound,
//                      not a suggestion.
//   3. ANCHORS         His boundary sampled every `anchorSpacingPx`, each snapped
//                      to the strongest ridge within `anchorSnapPx`. An anchor
//                      with no ridge is UNSUPPORTED and his line survives there.
//   4. TRACE           Dijkstra between consecutive supported anchors on
//                      cost = ridge + linked + proximity + direction. The path
//                      follows the printed edge wherever it goes — around a
//                      fillet, around the rounded end of a stage tag — because
//                      nothing in the cost function prefers straightness.
//   5. SUB-PIXEL       Each traced vertex is refined along the local path normal
//                      to the parabolic peak of |∂I/∂n|. A lattice path becomes
//                      a sub-pixel contour.
//   6. CRISP           Only THEN are genuinely straight stretches replaced by
//                      their total-least-squares line, so a straight printed edge
//                      comes out dead straight instead of a 1-px staircase. This
//                      is line-snap's move, demoted to a post-pass — the fallback,
//                      not the method.
//   7. RASTERIZE       Shared with line-snap: analytic in x, supersampled in y,
//                      nonzero winding (holes for free), his AA character kept.
//
// WHEN IT REFUSES (each a recorded param, each visible in the per-segment report):
//   - no artwork at all                                  ⇒ returns his mask untouched
//   - an anchor with no ridge ≥ `anchorMinStrength`       ⇒ unsupported, his line kept
//   - a traced path whose mean ridge < `segmentMinRidge`  ⇒ his line kept
//   - a traced path longer than `segmentMaxDetourRatio`×  ⇒ his line kept (a detour
//     his own span                                          around a texture blob is
//                                                            not the boundary he meant)
//   - no path inside the corridor                        ⇒ his line kept
//   - refinement only moves a vertex onto an edge ≥ `refineMinStrength`
//   - EVERY move is capped by `corridorPx` by construction
//
// Pure: pixels in, pixels + a report out. No I/O, no storage opinions — the
// generator wrapper (generator.ts `edge-trace`) is what the provenance system runs.
