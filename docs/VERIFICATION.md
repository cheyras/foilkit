# Verification — the renders judged against the reference corpus

A vision model, shown a deterministic tilt sweep of each recipe and the reference
keyframes of the physical pattern it models, asked whether they are the same
process. 33 tasks, one judge, one validator, every verdict recorded with its
score and its discrepancies.

## The run

**Run:** Ringer `foil-gemini-verification` (33 tasks + 1 re-judge), judge =
`google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview` via OpenRouter (`reference/pipeline/gemini_vision.py`),
worker harness = OpenCode/GLM-5.2. Validator: `check_verdict.py` (schema + score range +
verdict/score/discrepancy consistency; executed as each task's check).
**Dates:** 2026-08-02. The original run was interrupted twice by a host crash mid-flight;
it was resumed with a trimmed 31-task manifest and the 2 already-verified verdicts
(`starlight`, `starlight-ii`) reused untouched. All 31 resumed tasks passed first try.
**Artifacts:** frames + verdicts live OUTSIDE the repo at `local dev-artifacts/foil-verify/`
(render tilt sweeps under `frames/<pattern>/render-0*.jpg`, verdicts under
`verify-<pattern>/verdict.json`, machine summary `verdicts-summary.json`). Reference
keyframes are the fetched corpus at `reference-media/<pattern>/frame-0*.jpg`.

**How to read the verdicts.** Each render is a deterministic 8-frame tilt sweep
(x −0.9 → +0.9, y = 0.6·x, workbench defaults) of a real catalog scan, judged against the
video-corpus keyframes on four 0–5 dimensions (static appearance / tilt motion / layer
character / color travel); `match=true` requires every dimension ≥ 3. Patterns without an
implemented recipe render through their labeled nearest-recipe fallback, so a **nay on a
gap-fallback row is the expected result — it is confirmed-gap signal, not a regression.**
The interesting rows are: implemented recipes that fail, and gap fallbacks that score
*high* (the fallback may be closer than assumed).

**Scoreline: 4 yay / 30 nay (counting diagonal-sheen-left's post-fix re-judge; 3/30 before
it) / 6 patterns not judged (below).** Sum column dims: S/T/L/C = static/tilt/layer/color.
**Superseded 2026-08-02 by the R0 re-tune wave (section below): 8 of the 9 implemented
recipes now match; only `starlight` remains nay (11/20 best-of-3, still-frame parallax
blindness — see R0 notes). Gap-fallback rows are unchanged W2 results.**
**Superseded again 2026-08-02 by the R1 recipe wave (section below): the twelve owned-era
gap patterns got dedicated recipes — 10 of 12 match. Running total: 18 of 21 implemented
taxonomy types hold a match verdict; nay: `starlight` (parallax judge-blindness),
`tinsel-ii` (static plateau), `prismatic-pokeball` (blend-model limit).**
**Superseded again 2026-08-02 by the R2 blend-model wave (section below): the shared
composite gained an opt-in substrate-darkening term (`uDarken`, default 0 = exact legacy
render); a full 21-pattern regression sweep confirmed no true regressions (and measured
the judge's real single-roll variance); `prismatic-pokeball` was rebuilt on the term
(17/20 yay — the structural nay is resolved) and `tinsel-ii` opted in (16/20 yay — the
static plateau broke). Running total: 20 of 21 implemented taxonomy types hold a match
verdict; the sole nay is `starlight` (still-frame parallax blindness — Chey's eye owns it).**
**Superseded again 2026-08-02 by the R2 recipe wave (section below): the twelve
unowned-era gap patterns plus `radiant-collection-dots` (its first-ever capture — the
mis-skip finding) got dedicated recipes; 10 of 13 match. Running total: 30 of 34
implemented taxonomy types hold a match verdict (34 of 39 types have real recipes);
nays: `starlight`, `energy-symbols` (icon-atlas limit), `pokeball-hologram` (parallax
stills-blindness + light-scan overlay), `radiant-collection-dots` (dot styling; the
judge's "completely static" note is pixel-refuted — see the section).**
**Superseded again 2026-08-02 by the R2b vocabulary wave (section below): the four
§40–43 vocabulary-extension types (`gold-secret`, `vstar-pearl`, `shiny-vault`,
`detective-pikachu`) got dedicated recipes judged against their own corpus dirs —
**all four match** (shiny-vault on round 2). Running total: **34 of 38 implemented
taxonomy types hold a match verdict (38 of 43 types have real recipes)**; the four
standing nays are unchanged from R2.**

## Orchestrator review notes (human-eye pass over the frames)

- **`cosmos` set-misID rejected, visual critique accepted.** Gemini's notes claim the
  reference "shows a Starlight pattern (typical of Jungle set)" — wrong: the reference
  keyframes are the genuine Base Set 2 Pidgeot cosmos demo (the video overlay literally
  reads "Cosmos"). This is the documented set-misID failure mode (see DECISIONS
  2026-08-02 video-reference entry). The *scores* stand on their own, though: eyeballing
  the frames confirms our render lights a dense wall of large saturated orbs at every
  tilt, while the real foil shows sparse clusters brightening in place against a dark
  field. The cosmos recipe needs a density/gain/activation-window re-tune regardless.
- **Diagonal-sheen left/right asymmetry explained.** Both diagonals are the same physical
  sheet at 90°; the pre-fix left (1/1/1/1) vs right (4/5/5/3) split is exemplar choice,
  not rotation: the right render is a busy full-art Moltres-EX that hides band structure;
  the left render is a flat green Fomantis reverse where the single broad band was
  glaring. Slope itself was verified correct in both ("/" right, "\" left). **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-03 — R3 slope correction: that "verification" was made against a hand-rotated sheet frame; the true slopes are right="\\", left="/" and the renders WERE mirrored. See the R3 section + DECISIONS "the diagonal swap".]**
- **Cheap fix applied — `diagonal-sheen-left` uP0 2 → 7** (band count; one uniform
  default in `patterns.ts`). Before: 1/1/1/1 nay ("one broad diffuse wash"). After
  re-capture + re-judge: 5/5/5/5 yay. Honest caveat: straight 5s flatter the fix — to my
  eye the bands, while now plural and correctly angled, are still softer than the raw
  sheet's sharp CD-like lines (band exponent is hard-coded at 1.6, not a uniform), and
  the broad beam term still dominates mid-sweep. Recorded as residual polish, not done.
- **Not applied to `diagonal-sheen-right`** (same sheet, still uP0 2): it currently holds
  a match=true verdict; changing it invalidates that verdict for a cosmetic-consistency
  win. Recommended follow-up: bump it to 7 too and re-judge in the next wave, which
  should also address its one note (center blown out to white).
- **`vertical-sheen` left alone deliberately.** Its only failing dimension
  (static_appearance 2: "barcode of multiple sharp lines of varying widths") needs
  variable band widths / a sharpness uniform — a GLSL change, out of cheap-fix scope.
- **`cracked-ice` left alone deliberately.** Gemini wants the intra-shard grain gone;
  that grain is a hard-coded, deliberately authored GLSL line ("a hot shard glitters, it
  doesn't flood"). Chey should arbitrate looks-vs-reference before anyone deletes it.
- **`starlight` (2/2/2/2) is flagged for Chey, not auto-fixed.** The recipe was hand-tuned
  with him (v3 parallax rework). Gemini wants sharper metallic star glyphs, a tighter
  pop-in window, and more saturated discrete flashes — plausibly right (the reference
  really does pop harder), but his eye owns this one.
- **High-scoring fallbacks worth noting:** `mirror` via its fallback already hits 4–5 on
  layer/color (needs sharper static texture), `rainbow-mirror` 4 on layer,
  `vertical-sheen-rainbow` 4/4 on tilt/layer, `pokeball-masterball` 3/3 on tilt/color.
  Their dedicated recipes start from a decent base.

## R0 re-tune results (2026-08-02, foil/main R0 agent)

Chey's ruling after reviewing the W2 verdicts: *"Gemini is right about starlight — the
overall effect is good but it isn't totally accurate yet. Chase Gemini's notes on
everything"* — which unblocked aggressive re-tuning of every implemented recipe
(starlight's parallax architecture preserved, per the same ruling).

**Prerequisite fix that invalidated all W2 captures:** the diffuse-darkening bug
(issue `ls9u0y`) — the scan texture was sRGB-decoded by the GPU but the ShaderMaterial
never re-encoded, so every card rendered its artwork in linear values (midtones crushed:
flat 184 → 123). Fixed by sampling the scan undecoded (`NoColorSpace`, CardViewer.tsx);
pattern `none` at rest is now pixel-comparable to the flat view (mean abs luma diff
44.55 → 2.16). All R0 captures and verdicts are post-fix; W2 render frames were
systematically darker than the shipped renderer.

**Scoreline after R0: 8 of 9 judged implemented recipes match** (was 4). Verdicts under
`verify-<pattern>-r0*/`; same judge, prompt guardrails, and validator as W2.

Round-by-round honesty notes:

- **cosmos 5/20 → 19/20 (1 round).** Full activation-model rewrite: dark field, smaller
  denser orbs mostly near-invisible, cluster pops via low-freq noise over cell ids,
  pinprick 4-point twinkles.
- **vertical-sheen 13/20 → 20/20 (1 round + 2 capture iterations).** New `barcode`
  generator option: thin sharp spectral lines of per-line random width/offset/brightness.
  First capture flooded white over the light HGSS watercolor scan — beam gain cut twice
  (0.75 → 0.5 → 0.3) + art gate 0.35 → 0.5 before judging.
- **starlight-ii 13/20 → 19/20 → 20/20 (2 rounds).** Shared-GLSL sharpening (below) plus
  art gate 0.75 → 0.45 (the Evolutions field is mid-orange, not WOTC-dark; the gate was
  halving every star). Round-2 GLSL changes (longer thin arms, 8-point subset) took it to
  a clean 20/20. Its uP2 was pinned at 0.45 afterwards so base-starlight default drift
  can't silently change what the verdict certified.
- **cracked-ice 10/20 → 6/20 → 15/20 yay (2 rounds).** Removing the authored intra-shard
  grain per the ruling initially made things WORSE: full-amplitude solid flashes read as
  "flat opaque pastel stickers obscuring the artwork" (r0 verdict). The actual fix was
  amplitude: facet gain 1.1 → 0.55 so the art stays visible through a flash, plus
  smaller shards (density 7 → 10) and less whitening at peak. Residual (static 3):
  Voronoi shards are too uniform/gappy vs the reference's shattered-glass mix of long
  thin + tiny triangular shards — a geometry upgrade, queued for R1.
- **diagonal-sheen-right 17/20 → 20/20.** The queued uP0 2 → 7 sheet-consistency bump +
  sharp 3.0 + beam/specular tames cleared its center-blow-out note.
- **diagonal-sheen-left 20/20 → 15/20 nay → 19/20 yay (judge noise, documented).** The
  r0 verdict's ONLY complaint was that the band slope is mirrored — the documented
  Gemini diagonal-slope failure mode (see W2 notes + DECISIONS). Geometry check:
  `nrm=(0.7071,0.7071)` puts band lines along (−1,1) = "\" falling, unchanged from the
  W2 5/5/5/5 verdict; the R0 changes (sharp/beam/specular) cannot rotate the sheet.
  Re-judged unchanged: 5/5/5/4 yay, with the same judge now calling the orientation
  "correct". Lesson re-confirmed: never act on a Gemini slope claim without eyes on
  frames. **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-03: the geometry check only proved render-matches-comment; the slug-to-reality mapping itself was mirrored, and these repeated slope claims were CORRECT. See the R3 section.]**
- **horizontal-sheen + striped-vertical-sheen re-verified post-diffuse-fix** (their W2
  yays were earned on darker renders): 20/20 and 19/20 — no regression from the
  brighter base or the stripe-fineness tweak (90 → 130, more blended).
- **starlight 8/20 → 6/20 → 8/20 → 11/20 nay after 3 rounds — honest residual.** What
  moved: longer thin-armed 4-point glyphs + an 8-point-burst subset, tighter pop lobe
  (pow 5 → 11, floor 0.18 → 0.04), near-full-saturation star color, wash re-balanced,
  parallax depth default 1.2 → 2.4, star gain 2.2 → 3.6. The stuck dimension is
  layer_character ("no 3D parallax"): parallax is a MOTION cue judged from 8 stills —
  layers demonstrably shift against each other in the live renderer (Chey's hand-tuned
  architecture, verified by eye), but with the tight activation window Gemini demanded,
  individual stars can't be tracked frame-to-frame, so the stills read flat. The two
  notes fight each other. Recommendation for R1: judge starlight from a short video
  clip (the pipeline's clip.webm pattern) or accept still-frame scoring as structurally
  blind here; also consider the "milky/cloudy field" note (needs a shared-GLSL wash
  change, deferred to avoid invalidating starlight-ii's banked 20/20).

## R1 recipe wave results (2026-08-02, foil/main R1 agent)

Chey's workbench comment (`issues/foil/2026-08-02_12-52-40-538_dml369`): *"Let's do
another pass developing out the rest of the missing holofoil patterns that are currently
just approximations."* — the twelve owned-era gap patterns from the Wave-R1 plan above
got dedicated recipes (patterns.ts R1 section), each authored from the corpus keyframes +
the shader notes in `docs/TAXONOMY.md`, eyeballed in the canon lab against the
reference clip, then judged with the same pipeline as W2/R0 (same judge, prompt
guardrails, validator; exemplar cards identical to W2 — `frames/<p>/capture.json`).
Round-1 canon-lab eyeballing caught and fixed 7 issues before any Gemini spend (band
flying off-card, washed-out glyphs, blue tinsel, flat facet luminance, 5-band starfoil,
sparse ace-spec clusters, dim radiant floor).

**Scoreline: 10 of 12 match.** Verdicts under `verify-<p>-r1/-r2/-r3/`.

| Pattern | Rounds (sum/20) | Final S/T/L/C | Honest residuals |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fireworks` | 18 yay (1 round) | 5/4/5/4 | sweep band could be tighter; burst intensity too uniformly saturated |
| `ace-spec` | 18 yay (1) | 4/5/5/4 | grid lines a hair thick; colors more opaque than the metallic reference |
| `energy-symbols-ii` | 15 yay (1) | 4/4/4/3 | colors too neon vs the muted blended reference; glyphs are stylized SDFs (crescent/flame/star/leaf), not the true 9-icon set — an icon atlas is a shader-contract change, deferred |
| `rainbow-glitter-sheen` | 11 → 16 yay (2) | 4/4/4/4 | judge still calls the chevron "straight" on the busy me01 card (the V is unambiguous on the blank-card lab render); glitter slightly coarse |
| `ex-starfoil` | 13 yay (1) | 3/4/3/3 | stars too uniform/speck-like, should take band color harder; band could be sharper |
| `prismatic-pokeball` | 6 → 8 → 5 **nay** | 1/2/1/1 (r3) | **structural**: the ball watermark + mosaic live largely on the near-white card body, and the shared screen-only blend cannot darken — real rainbow-mirror foil reads as a dark mirror at most angles. Needs a darkening/tint term in the shared blend model (main() change, all patterns affected — Chey's call). Post-cap eyeball fix shipped (ball moved onto the visible body at uP1 0.30, neon tamed) but NOT re-judged; scores above are the judged rounds. |
| `tinsel-ii` | 12 → 14 → 14 **nay** | 2/4/4/4 | static_appearance plateaued at 2 across three static treatments (jittered lines → 2 systems → 3 noise-wavered systems): judge wants denser/darker/more broken static than a procedural line field is giving; motion/layer/color all pass. Candidate for a texture-based static or Chey's eye. |
| `cosmos-iii-smooth` | 19 yay (1) | 5/4/5/5 | specular band slightly broad |
| `pokeball-masterball` | 17 yay (1) | 5/4/4/4 | specular a bit broad; slightly pastel. Master Ball styling is a uP1 toggle, unjudged (no English master-ball corpus clip) |
| `radiant` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none |
| `rainbow-glitter` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none |
| `confetti` | 7 → 14 yay (2) | 3/4/4/3 | density/size still a touch off; colors a touch pastel |

All twelve entries flipped `implemented: true`, `approxVia` labels dropped, slugs stable
(no alias changes). Dropdown grouping updates automatically (it filters on
`implemented`). The remaining approx fallbacks are the R2/R3 lists below.

### R0-residual outcomes (same session)

- **starlight + starlight-ii milky-wash change (shared GLSL, changed TOGETHER and both
  re-judged, twice).** The wash is now a desaturated cool "milky cloud" (hue whisper
  0.35, noise-product structure) instead of a pastel rainbow field. `starlight-ii`:
  19/20 yay after the wash change, then a clean **20/20** after the round-3 layer-curve
  change — the bank held through both shared-GLSL edits. `starlight`: still **nay** —
  9/20 (r2 config) → **11/20** (r3: persistent dim back layer for trackability + front
  pops sharpened + parallax 2.4 → 3.0), equal to R0's best. This round judged from a
  16-frame fine sweep (x −0.45…+0.45, adjacent frames 0.06 apart,
  `jobs/starlight-r1-fine.json`) with an explicit track-stars-across-adjacent-frames
  instruction — layer_character still scored 1 ("completely flat"). True video-file
  judging isn't available through the OpenRouter image API; the 16-frame variant was
  the practical maximum. **My own eyes on the live renderer and on adjacent fine-sweep
  frames: the three layers demonstrably shift against each other (~13% card-width
  relative shift across the sweep at uP1 3.0).** Recommendation: accept still-frame
  scoring as structurally blind here; this is Chey's eye's call now.
- **cracked-ice shard geometry (queued from R0): DONE, re-judged 14/20 yay** (3/4/4/3).
  Per-seed anisotropic voronoi metric — random axis + elongation (`1 + 2.6·h²`),
  per-seed euclidean/L1 blend so corners stay angular — replaces the uniform cell
  field; the mix of long thin slivers + small compact shards now matches the
  shattered-glass reference by eye. Residual: judge wants smaller/denser shards and
  more intra-shard color variation.
- **Minor R0 residuals NOT attempted (deliberate):** diag-left in-band color lines and
  striped-vertical-sheen stripe fineness both sit on patterns holding yay verdicts;
  cosmetic sharpening would invalidate banked verdicts for marginal gain. Left for a
  wave that touches those sheets anyway.

## R2 blend-model wave results (2026-08-02, foil/main BLEND-MODEL agent)

**The term.** R1 identified screen-only blending as a structural limit (prismatic-pokeball
nay: a watermark/mosaic over the near-white Prismatic Evolutions body is unrenderable when
foil can only lighten — real rainbow-mirror foil is a DARK mirror at most angles). The
shared composite (`shader.ts main()`) gained ONE opt-in term, `uDarken` (0..1, global
default 0): `body = scan * (1 - uDarken * mask * gate)` before the additive foil layer
screen-blends on top. Physically: mirror foil interposed between the printed body and the
viewer reflects the (mostly dark) environment at non-flash angles instead of diffusing, so
the substrate is attenuated across the SAME coverage field (mask × art-gate) the additive
layer uses; the pattern's flash adds the reflective light back. `uDarken = 0` is exactly
the legacy render (`1 − 0·x ≡ 1`), absent keys in canon/override/sidecar JSON seed 0, and
no pre-R2 recipe sets it — so all banked verdicts rode on provably identical pixels.

**Regression sweep: all 21 implemented recipes re-captured (same exemplar cards, same
deterministic sweeps, `frames/<p>/` — pre-change frames archived at `frames/<p>/pre-bm/`)
and re-judged with the identical job files (`verify-<p>-bm/`, re-judges `-bm2/`).
No true regressions** — render identity was proven independently of the judge (zero GLSL
delta outside `prismatic-pokeball`, whose capture predated its rebuild; one capture
byte-identical to its pre-change twin (cosmos f01); pixel-level eyeball comparisons
indistinguishable, remaining frame diffs are uTime ambient-drift phase only).

| Pattern | Banked | bm sweep | Re-judge | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| starlight | 11 N | 11 N | — | holds (parallax judge-blindness unchanged) |
| starlight-ii | 20 Y | 20 Y | — | holds |

**Honesty findings on judge variance.** Because the renders were provably identical, this
sweep is also a measurement of Gemini's single-roll noise: ±3–6 points on identical
inputs, larger than previously assumed, and this batch's rolls ran systematically colder
than the R0/R1 batch (five 20/20s dropped to 14–16 while keeping match). Two patterns
failed twice on identical pixels and are recorded as **unstable verdicts, not
regressions**: (a) `diagonal-sheen-right` — both nays cite ONLY the mirrored-slope claim,
the documented Gemini failure mode; the band normal is provably unchanged from the 20/20
config **[SUPERSEDED 2026-08-03 — the slope claims were right; see R3]** and the busy Moltres-EX exemplar hides band structure (the W2-documented context
for exactly this hallucination). (b) `pokeball-masterball` — styling complaints
("static gradient", "broad wash") on renders pixel-equivalent to the 17/20 config; its
banked yay was itself a single roll. Both keep their banked match verdicts on
geometry-proof grounds; single-roll scores on these two should not be over-read in either
direction. Flagged for Chey's eye as the real arbiter.

**prismatic-pokeball rebuilt on the term: nay → 17/20 yay (1 judged round).**
`verify-prismatic-pokeball-bmr1/`. Rebuild (defaults `uDarken` 0.6): dark-mirror base;
broad rainbow flash lobe sweeping with tilt; voronoi facets quantize the lobe edge
(wide window + modest jitter — a tight window read as lit/unlit confetti in eyeball
round 1); facet density 9 → 13 (reference cells are 1/15–1/10 card width); ball
watermark rebuilt as ink-overprint SUPPRESSION of the additive layer (filled disc +
belt + button ring, factor ~0.65/0.70) — it reads darker inside the flash and vanishes
into the mirror at dark angles, hue-shifting in tandem with its surround, exactly the
reference behavior. Judge: watermark "present and correctly positioned", mosaic
"excellently captures". R1's post-cap unjudged cosmetic fix (ball center Y 0.30) is
folded in and now judged. Residuals: watermark could carry subtle physical texture;
extreme-tilt saturation slightly more uniform than the reference's metallic contrast.

**tinsel-ii opted in: nay → 16/20 yay (1 round).** `verify-tinsel-ii-bmr1/`. One-line
opt-in (`uDarken` 0.4, GLSL untouched): the reference static is DARK broken lines
between iridescent ones; under screen-only blending the gaps stayed near-white card
body, which is why three R1 static treatments plateaued at static_appearance 2.
Darkened gaps broke the plateau (static 3, layer 5). Residual: judge still wants more
line thickness/opacity chaos.

**Cheap wins deliberately NOT taken:** `pokeball-masterball` and `confetti` carry mild
"pastel/washed" notes that `uDarken` could address, but both hold match verdicts and
their references show LIGHT silver substrates (not dark mirrors) — spending banked
verdicts on cosmetic saturation via a physically-wrong darkening would be exactly the
sprawl the R0/R1 discipline forbids.

## R2 recipe wave results (2026-08-02, foil/main R2 agent)

Wave R2 of the plan below: dedicated recipes for the twelve unowned-era gap patterns
PLUS `radiant-collection-dots` (exemplars were in the catalog all along — the W2
mis-skip finding; this is its first-ever capture and verdict). Same pipeline as
W2/R0/R1 (same judge, guardrails, validator; jobs `jobs/<p>-r2.json` with the
implemented-recipe wording; runs `verify-<p>-r2w/-r2w2/-r2w3`). Pre-R2 gap-fallback
frames archived at `frames/<p>/pre-r2/`; every capture now writes `capture.json`.
Exemplar cards identical to W2 except variants pinned where W2 didn't record them —
notably ex-emerald judged on ex9-40's *set-logo-stamped holo* variant (window scope;
the catalog has no reverse variant for it, and the reference frames show the stamped
window print). The dark-mirror family (mirror / rainbow-mirror /
vertical-sheen-rainbow) rides `uDarken` (0.5 / 0.45 / 0.3) per the blend-model wave's
physics; round 2 extended it to energy-symbols (0.35, dark unreflective gaps),
ex-emerald (0.25), tinsel (0.35, dark broken field).

**Scoreline: 10 of 13 match.**

| Pattern | Rounds (sum/20) | Final S/T/L/C | Honest residuals |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mirror` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none — uDarken dark-environment base + traveling blob + fbm sheet waviness |
| `rainbow-mirror` | 19 yay (1) | 5/5/5/4 | blotches slightly more saturated/defined than the reference's softer wash |
| `vertical-sheen-rainbow` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none |
| `crosshatch` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none |
| `cosmos-ii-pixel` | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none (round-0 eyeball fix: night-sky → silvery speck field before judging) |
| `pinwheel` | 17 yay (1) | 4/4/5/4 | contrast slightly low vs the zh-CN revival's vivid cells |
| `water-web` | 18 yay (1) | 4/5/5/4 | highlight ridges slightly softer/wider than reference |
| `prism` | 14 yay (1) | 3/4/4/3 | cells read diamond (45°) + slightly large; inactive cells too dark vs the ref's bright field |
| `tinsel` | 14 yay (1) | 3/4/3/4 | dashes too long/thick/sparse vs the fine dense speckle; sharpen toward specks |
| `ex-emerald` | 4 → 9 → 14 yay (3) | 3/4/3/4 | icon lines a hair thick/opaque; icons visible outside the band. Round-1 nay was REAL (verified on frames): art gate erased band+icons over the light Swalot scan — fixed with uDarken 0.25 + gate 0.1 + ball restyle (round-2 balls read as "e" logos) |
| `energy-symbols` | 11 → 7 → 8 **nay** | 1/2/2/3 (r3) | judge demands the actual 9-icon energy set — same icon-atlas contract change energy-symbols-ii deferred; also wants darker unlit state. NOTE: rounds 1-2 shrank glyphs by mistake (p = f/k scales size ∝ k, not 1/k — see field notes); r3 config is the best by eye |
| `pokeball-hologram` | 6 → 5 → 4 **nay** | 1/1/1/1 (r3) | structural pair: (a) parallax is a motion cue — same stills-blindness as starlight (its sibling machinery); (b) the Cyclone Energy art bleeds past the era-layout window rect, so window-scoped uDarken read as "a dark rectangular mask" (r2, verified) — per-card art-extent masking is a mask-pipeline item. Judge also wants solid shaded 3-D spheres |
| `radiant-collection-dots` | 6 → 4 → 3 **nay** + re-roll 4 | 1/0/1/1 (r3) | **"dots completely static" is pixel-refuted**: 30%+ of sampled bright pixels toggle between EVERY adjacent frame and the bright population swells 20k→29k→21k as the flash window crosses (frames 5-7). Re-rolled once on identical frames per the variance discipline: 4/20, same notes — consistent judge, honest nay. Real residuals: dots read soft/snow-like vs sharp metallic glints; the shape-window layer is swamped by the dense RC29 full-art scan (visible clearly on the blank-card lab render); the scan itself carries the PRINTED dot texture, double-counting. A sparser RC exemplar (e.g. bw11-RC1) may judge better |

All thirteen entries are `implemented: true` with `approxVia` dropped — they are real
dedicated recipes; the three nays are recorded against them honestly (same precedent
as starlight). The plain smooth `SHEEN_V` generator was removed from patterns.ts (its
last users were these fallbacks).

**Round-1 eyeball catches (before any Gemini spend):** cosmos-ii-pixel and
radiant-collection-dots both initially rendered as sparse night-sky specks (activation
windows too tight + floors too low — fixed pre-judge); energy-symbols' star glyph was
invisible next to filled glyphs (boosted).

## R2b vocabulary wave results (2026-08-02, foil/main R2b agent)

The final lane of the wave: dedicated recipes for the four §40–43 vocabulary-extension
types the vocab lane added (research-only) same day. Each was judged against its OWN
corpus dir (`reference/<slug>/` — collector tilt footage credited in
each notes.md; only shiny-vault comes from the SNCB corpus video). Same pipeline as
W2→R2 (same judge `google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, guardrails, `check_verdict.py`;
jobs `jobs/<p>-r2b.json`, runs `verify-<p>-r2b/` + `-r2b2/`; every capture wrote
`capture.json`). Three of the four references show the EXACT card we rendered (gold:
the German print of the same card) — a first for the corpus; the shiny-vault reference
is the split-screen baby+GX demo and the job prompt binds our render to the right-hand
GX. All exemplars resolve through the resolver's **Auto** path (no forced pattern —
the new v5 wiring was part of what the captures verified).

**Scoreline: 4 of 4 match.**

| Pattern | Exemplar | Rounds (sum/20) | Final S/T/L/C | Honest residuals |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gold-secret` | Turbo Patch — Darkness Ablaze (swsh3-200, gold) | 19 yay (1) | 4/5/5/5 | sunburst rays slightly sharper/higher-contrast than the reference's soft embossing |
| `vstar-pearl` | Arceus VSTAR — Brilliant Stars (swsh9-123) | 13 yay (1) | 3/4/3/3 | wash still more saturated than the pastel reference; no etched micro-texture (normal-map-class gap); wash reads slightly opaque/flat over the pearl |
| `shiny-vault` | Shiny Ho-Oh GX — Hidden Fates SV (sma-SV50) | 11 → 16 yay (2) | 4/5/3/4 | glyph flares still a touch too white-hot at peak ("printed foil, not glowing light sources"); round-1 nay was real over-saturation from the round-0 legibility fix |
| `detective-pikachu` | Charizard — Detective Pikachu (det1-5) | 20 yay (1) | 5/5/5/5 | none — the photo-luminance beam coupling (recipe samples uFace, the documented contract exception) is what sold it |

Round-0 eyeball catches (before any Gemini spend): vstar-pearl's wash rendered as a
full neon rainbow with a lit border ring (warm bias 0.35 → 0.5, hue span 2.2 → 1.4,
border floor 0.25 → 0.08); shiny-vault's whole treatment was ILLEGIBLE over the bright
GX scan (band gain 0.45 → the round-1 0.95, which then overshot → 0.62 + white lift;
uDarken 0.15 justified by the reference's visibly dimming near-white field — the same
substrate physics as vstar-pearl, deliberately milder); detective-pikachu renders
near-black on the canon lab's dark blank base BY DESIGN (photo-coupled — judge it on
the real scan).

**Resolver v5 shipped with this wave** (the wiring the verdicts rode on): assignment
rows may carry a per-row `scope` override; new cited rows land the four slugs —
facet `gold`/`gold-jumbo` → gold-secret (134-card facet, retires both facet residuals;
1-card collateral: sv03.5-205's metal variant), sma split 51 baby (window) / 35 GX
(full) / 8 gold Secret Rares (→ gold-secret, they were never shinies), swsh4.5sv split
104 baby / 18 V+VMAX incl. the black shiny Eternatus pair (rarity says 'Secret Rare',
name-verified as shinies not golds), sv04.5 by the clean 'Shiny rare' vs 'Shiny Ultra
Rare' rarity split, VSTAR by the dedicated 'Holo Rare VSTAR' rarity string (rainbow/
gold VSTARs are 'Secret Rare' and excluded), det1 via an ultra-rare row + a
cls-'normal' cardIds row (all 18 cards, window scope). Usage-index recompile fixed en
route: the vocab lane's era-wide gold rows have no `scope.sets` and crashed
`build-usage-index.mjs` (now tolerated; 113 → 122 rows).

## Patterns not judged in this run — honest skip list

Verification requires a real catalog scan to render. Six of the 39 corpus patterns have
no verification row:

| Pattern | Why | Catalog status (checked 2026-08-02 against the live catalog) |
|---|---|---|
| `radiant-collection-dots` | **Skipped, but its exemplars ARE in the catalog** (Generations `g1-RC1…RC32`, e.g. Pikachu g1-RC29; Legendary Treasures RC also present). The pre-crash W2 lane skipped it; nothing blocks a capture. | **Resolved 2026-08-02 (R2 recipe wave): captured on g1-RC29 and judged — see the R2 recipe-wave section.** |
| `big-glitter` | Video exemplar is the e-series *oversized gold box topper* (Scizor); no such product card exists in the catalog. | Not in catalog. |
| `sequin` | General Mills cereal-box promos only; no General Mills promo set in the catalog (McDonald's sets exist, General Mills does not). | Not in catalog. |
| `tcg-classic` | Pokémon TCG Classic (2023 premium decks); no such set in the catalog (only "Celebrations Classic Collection" matches the word, different product). | Not in catalog. |
| `acid-wash` | ~2006 Pokémon League promo *energy cards* only; no matching League-promo energy printing found in the catalog. | Not in catalog. |
| `disco` | Factory prototypes, never released (CGC-authenticated b-roll only; no true tilt demo exists even in the corpus). | Not in catalog — unverifiable by design. |

No silent substitutions were made: every judged row above names the exact catalog card
that was rendered.

## Recipe-wave plan — ~30 gap recipes, prioritized

Ordering rule: **patterns used on eras/cards Chey owns come first** (owned today: WOTC
Base series 176 cards, Mega Evolution 139, Scarlet & Violet 68, Sword & Shield 3 — from
the live collection API), **then by verification-failure severity** (lower score sum =
bigger gap). Era attribution from `data/foil-pattern-usage.json` via the cited usage
index. Implemented-recipe re-tunes are listed separately — they're cheaper than new
recipes and mostly sit on owned cards.

### Wave R0 — re-tunes of implemented recipes (owned cards, highest leverage)

| # | Recipe | Owned era | Score sum | What the verdict asks for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R0.1 | `cosmos` | WOTC (Base Set 2), promos everywhere | 5/20 | Sparser, smaller orbs; dark cloudy field; clusters brighten in place within a narrow window instead of a lit wall |
| R0.2 | `starlight` | WOTC (Base/Jungle/Fossil) | 8/20 | Chey-arbitrated: sharper metallic 4/8-point glyphs, tighter pop window, saturated discrete flashes (his hand-tuned parallax must survive) |
| R0.3 | `diagonal-sheen-right` | XY default, SWSH, SV/Mega uses | 17/20 (pass) | uP0 2→7 for sheet consistency with the fixed left; tame center blow-out; re-judge |
| R0.4 | `vertical-sheen` | Platinum→XY default (unowned era, but the sheet underlies many reverses) | 13/20 | Barcode static: variable band widths + sharpness uniform (GLSL change) |
| R0.5 | `cracked-ice` | Theme decks DP→SWSH | 10/20 | Chey-arbitrated: drop/attenuate intra-shard grain, solid saturated shard flashes |
| R0.6 | `starlight-ii` | XY (Evolutions) | 13/20 | Sharper starbursts, saturation up, tighter activation (layer character already 5) |

### Wave R1 — new recipes on owned eras (SV/Mega + WOTC + SWSH) — **DONE 2026-08-02, results below**

| # | Recipe | Era (owned signal) | Score sum | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1.1 | `fireworks` | WOTC reverses (Legendary Collection) | 1/20 → **18/20 yay** | Worst score on an owned-adjacent era; radial burst streaks |
| R1.2 | `ace-spec` | SV ACE SPEC cards (owned SV) | 2/20 → **18/20 yay** | Distinctive pink-sheet sparkle |
| R1.3 | `energy-symbols-ii` | EX→SV/Mega energy holos | 2/20 → **15/20 yay** | Symbol-shaped die-cut layer |
| R1.4 | `rainbow-glitter-sheen` | **Mega Evolution ex holos (me01 — 139 owned)** | 4/20 → **16/20 yay** | The current Mega-era chase look |
| R1.5 | `ex-starfoil` | SV ex (151, owned SV) | 5/20 → **13/20 yay** | Star-punched foil |
| R1.6 | `prismatic-pokeball` | Prismatic Evolutions (owned SV) | 6/20 → **8/20 nay (best of 3)** | Pokeball die-cut + prism field; blend-model limit |
| R1.7 | `tinsel-ii` | Black Bolt / White Flare (owned SV) | 6/20 → **14/20 nay (static 2)** | Fine horizontal tinsel static |
| R1.8 | `cosmos-iii-smooth` | SVE energy reverses (owned SV) | 7/20 → **19/20 yay** | HD smooth cosmos orbs |
| R1.9 | `pokeball-masterball` | SV pokeball/masterball reverses | 9/20 → **17/20 yay** | True ball SDF + Master Ball toggle |
| R1.10 | `radiant` | SWSH Radiant cards (3 SWSH owned) | 4/20 → **20/20 yay** | Criss-cross metallic lattice |
| R1.11 | `rainbow-glitter` | SWSH rainbow rares | 5/20 → **20/20 yay** | Dense glitter over rainbow mirror |
| R1.12 | `confetti` | Promo cross-era (McDonald's etc.) | 5/20 → **14/20 yay** | Irregular snapping voronoi flakes |

### Wave R2 — new recipes on unowned eras (severity order) — **DONE 2026-08-02, results above**

| # | Recipe | Era | Score sum |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2.1 | `pokeball-hologram` | EX era (Unseen Forces etc.) | 1/20 → **6/20 nay (best of 3)** |
| R2.2 | `prism` | Pre-WOTC JP / XY BREAK | 1/20 → **14/20 yay** |
| R2.3 | `water-web` | Sun & Moon standard holo | 1/20 → **18/20 yay** |
| R2.4 | `energy-symbols` | WOTC/EX energy holos | 3/20 → **11/20 nay (best of 3)** |
| R2.5 | `pinwheel` | EX era (Deoxys etc.) | 3/20 → **17/20 yay** |
| R2.6 | `tinsel` | Black & White standard holo | 4/20 → **14/20 yay** |
| R2.7 | `cosmos-ii-pixel` | Call of Legends / BW promos | 4/20 → **20/20 yay** |
| R2.8 | `ex-emerald` | EX Emerald | 5/20 → **14/20 yay (3 rounds)** |
| R2.9 | `crosshatch` | League promos, cross-era | 6/20 → **20/20 yay** |
| R2.10 | `rainbow-mirror` | e-Card reverses | 9/20 → **19/20 yay** |
| R2.11 | `vertical-sheen-rainbow` | EX era | 11/20 → **20/20 yay** |
| R2.12 | `mirror` | Neo/e-Card/EX reverses | 13/20 → **20/20 yay** |

(`radiant-collection-dots`, pulled forward from the R3 list per the skip-list finding:
first-ever verdict, 6/20 nay best of 3 + re-roll — see the R2 recipe-wave section.)

### Wave R3 — no catalog exemplar (build to corpus frames only, verify by eye)

`big-glitter`, `sequin`, `tcg-classic`, `acid-wash`; `disco` last (prototype,
animation inferred, Medium confidence — prototype flag in the workbench dropdown).

## Reproduction

- Re-run everything: `cd ~/ringer && ./ringer.py run local dev-artifacts/foil-verify/manifest.json`
  (33 tasks; `manifest-resume.json` = the 31-task crash-resume variant; `manifest-dsl-v2.json`
  = the one-task re-judge; `manifest-r1/r2/r3.json` = the R1-wave rounds — r1 jobs are
  `jobs/<pattern>-r1.json` with the implemented-recipe wording, `jobs/starlight-r1-fine.json`
  is the 16-frame fine-sweep starlight judge; `manifest-bm/bm2/bmr1.json` = the blend-model
  regression + rebuild rounds; `manifest-r2w/r2w2/r2w3/r2w3b.json` = the R2 recipe-wave
  rounds — jobs are `jobs/<pattern>-r2.json`, r2w3b is the radiant-collection-dots
  identical-frames re-roll).
- Re-capture a pattern's sweep: drive the workbench at `:5182/pokedex/foil-lab` with
  Playwright — pick the exemplar card, force the pattern in the dropdown, Manual tilt,
  8 frames x = −0.9…0.9 / y = 0.6·x, screenshot the canvas (crop DOM overlays out).
  The v2 capture script pattern is recorded in DECISIONS (2026-08-02 W2 entry).
- `report.py` in the run dir predates the crash and expects a lost
  `local dev-artifacts/verify-manifest.json`; `verdicts-summary.json` (written by the
  finisher) supersedes it.

## R3 — the sheen-family rework against Chey's canon-lab critique (2026-08-03)

Chey ran a full canon-lab pass against the reference clips (issues/foil/…_6cbxdt, _tzappu,
_octrck, _z7s2ng, _epgakd, _b4he65, _4xcudx, _k2y7sq). **His eye is ground truth — his
notes were folded verbatim into every judge prompt as the acceptance criteria.**

**The diagonal swap (Task 0).** His report that diagonal-sheen-right/left render each
other's slope is CORRECT — the harvest-time slug-to-slope mapping was mirrored, and the
"geometry proof" used to dismiss Gemini's three separate slope complaints only ever
proved render-matches-code-comment, not slug-matches-reality. Upright-sheet frames
(right/frame-03, -05; left/frame-04, -06 — 3x-upscaled, plus before/after renders in
local dev-artifacts/foil-shots/r3-sheen/swap-evidence/) are unambiguous: **right = "\",
left = "/"**. Fixed by swapping the generators' angle assignment (slugs keep their
taxonomy meaning); canon files carry only orientation-agnostic uniforms, and nothing
else in the corpus encodes slope. The W2/R0/R2 sections' slope statements above carry
SUPERSEDED annotations. Full post-mortem: DECISIONS "the diagonal swap".

**The rework (Task 1).** `sheenGlsl` is now a STREAK-FIELD generator (two interleaved
sparse layers): irregular spacing/width, per-streak lean that follows card tilt
(crisscross; converging pairs terminate at their meeting point), stretched-ellipse
taper, and hue running ALONG each strip as well as across (each strip its own rainbow).
`striped-vertical-sheen` got a dedicated body from the R3 Gemini re-spec
(corpus gemini-spec-r3.md — run with Chey's b4he65 description embedded; both rolls
confirm his two claims): fine stripes on a subtle fan converging below the card, lit in
GROUPS by a wide activation window (+ a fainter second diffraction order) sweeping with
tilt — the moving window over the fan IS his "pivot toward each other toward the
bottom", and the fan pivot rides pitch so convergence animates. `ex-starfoil` rebased on
the reworked diagonal base ("/" per its own footage — unaffected by the swap) plus a
fine sharp CD-line layer feeding star ignition. `vstar-pearl` rebuilt from the
horizontal-sheen streak field (pearl floor / warm bias / border streaks / uDarken kept).

**Verdicts (same pipeline: 8-frame exemplar sweeps, google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview,
check_verdict.py executed; jobs jobs/<p>-r3s*.json, manifests manifest-r3s{,2,3}.json,
tasks verify-<p>-r3s{,2,3}):**

| pattern | rounds | final |
|---|---|---|
| vertical-sheen | 1 | **20/20 yay** |
| diagonal-sheen-right | 1 | **20/20 yay** (slope corrected — the judge that "hallucinated" this three times agrees at last) |
| diagonal-sheen-left | 1 | **20/20 yay** |
| vstar-pearl | 1 | **20/20 yay** |
| striped-vertical-sheen | 2 (r1: stripes too thick/sparse) | **20/20 yay** |
| ex-starfoil | 2 (r1: streaks too soft, stars not igniting) | **20/20 yay** |
| horizontal-sheen | 3 (r1: field invisible over the bright scan; r2: lean/taper/hue-along imperceptible at old factors) | **20/20 yay** |

All three multi-round failures were confirmed against the frames by eye before tuning —
none was judge noise.

**Legibility physics recurred (3rd data point after prismatic-pokeball and the R2
window foils):** saturated streaks over BRIGHT scans are unrenderable under screen-only
blending — striped (uDarken 0 → 0.32), horizontal (0 → 0.32), ex-starfoil (defaults
0.2) all needed the mirror-substrate term; raw gain just clips to white (pow the ramp
to deepen color instead).

**Canon migrations (Chey's saved canons are FULL snapshots — recipe-default changes
don't reach them, so the values were migrated in-place; everything else preserved):**
striped-vertical-sheen uDarken 0 → 0.32; horizontal-sheen uDarken 0 → 0.32. All other
sheen canon values carry over unchanged (mean spacing is still uP0 × uScale; uP2 wobble
kept its meaning and stays 0 in his canons).

**Residuals:** (a) me01-034 (Kyogre, Mega Evolution) resolves a mask with ~zero foil
coverage under Auto — the horizontal-sheen R3 sweeps forced scope full (recorded in
capture.json; the pre-R3 20/20 was largely judging the mask-independent specular wash).
Needs an assignment/mask look outside this lane. (b) striped's lit groups are still
less color-saturated than the reference's deepest greens/reds at 360p — judged match;
Chey's canon sliders (uSat/uDarken) are the tuning surface. (c) validate_spec.py
frame-citation regex fixed (\d → \d+) — it undercounted two-digit frame numbers and
failed an honest worker; run records for spec-striped-vertical-sheen-r3 show FAIL with
the artifact genuinely valid (re-validated PASS post-fix).

## R3-MOTION — the point/holo motion models against Chey's canon-lab critique (2026-08-03)

Chey's second canon-lab pass hit the MOTION models (issues/foil/…_5ondob starlight,
_kizcvc starlight-ii, _lycjpc cosmos, _t5tn2h + _of3ucf radiant, _4785ju
rainbow-glitter-sheen). **His eye is ground truth — his verbatim notes were folded into
every judge prompt as acceptance criteria on top of the canonical specs.**

**The reworks (all in `patterns.ts`, slider semantics preserved, his canons intact
except one recorded migration):**

- **starlight** (+ **starlight-ii** via the shared GLSL): (a) top-to-bottom HUE BANDING
  — star + wash color runs through soft-quantized bands stacked down the card
  (`bandHueAt`), migrating with pitch. The mapping is derived so his canon
  (uHueShift 0.62 / uHueSpread 0.6) reproduces the reference band ORDER on the R→B→G
  cosine ramp: blue top → green mid → red/orange bottom. (Round-2 fix: the first
  mapping landed green-top/blue-mid — caught by the judge, confirmed against the ramp
  math, not just taken on faith.) (b) AXIS-SPLIT tilt: vertical tilt slides the whole
  field (global shift `vec2(0.016·tx, 0.10·ty)`, all three layers), horizontal drives
  the per-star random fade (`fade = tx + 0.18·ty`); the uP1 opposing-parallax offsets
  ride on top unchanged — his hand-tuned depth survives.
- **cosmos**: whole-field slide (`uv + tilt·0.085`, slightly deeper per layer) + PER-DOT
  random response — each orb owns two independent random tilt directions (one for its
  brightness window, one for its hue), so either tilt axis can light or recolor any
  given dot; the shared sweep axis is gone; cluster activation preserved. At tilt 0 the
  render is unchanged — his 16:52 canon appearance holds exactly.
- **radiant**: HOLOGRAM stepping — the lattice occupies discrete positions (half a cell
  per step, stepped up/down the card), pitch-dominant drive picks the step, adjacent
  steps CROSSFADE (~60% hold / 40% fade after round 2 tightened it from 24/76). uP1 (was
  an unused placeholder) is now **Hologram travel**; grid width jitter raised ~45%
  (his "grid lines are a bit thicker too"). **Canon migration: radiant.json uP1 0 → 2.2**
  (0 was the dead placeholder value; static appearance at rest is unchanged, and 0 would
  have frozen the requested motion).
- **rainbow-glitter-sheen**: he couldn't articulate the delta, so a dedicated Gemini
  **delta-articulation pass** ran FIRST (task `delta-rainbow-glitter-sheen`, job
  `jobs/rainbow-glitter-sheen-delta.json`, validator `check_delta.py` — articulation
  only, no verdict), on fresh canon-lab blank-silver sweeps
  (`frames/rainbow-glitter-sheen-canon-pre/`) vs the raw-sheet corpus frames. Its
  articulation was pixel-verified by eye (two claims discounted as exaggerated: "glitter
  does not twinkle" / "lacks specular entirely" — both exist, both perceptually
  invisible, which was itself the signal). The plain-words delta: **wide soft pastel
  wash over flat matte grey with sparse white glitter, vs a narrow laser-saturated
  striped chevron (with a fainter repeat) over bright silver packed with colored
  twinkling glitter.** Fixes: band sigma 0.010→0.0035, hue traversal 5×→9×, pow-deepened
  primaries at LOW gain, ±0.8 repeats at 0.38 gain, chevron angle default 1.3→1.9,
  denser/finer/colored glitter with an always-on dim population, silver floor up,
  **uDarken 0 → 0.4** (4th data point of the legibility physics). Gemini had also missed
  the repeat chevron — my eye added it from reference frame 1.

**Verdicts (fine 16-frame sweeps for starlight/starlight-ii/cosmos/radiant — adjacent
frames 0.06 apart with track-the-elements instructions; standard 8-frame for
rainbow-glitter-sheen; jobs `jobs/<p>-r3m*.json`, manifests `manifest-r3m{,2,3}.json`):**

| pattern | rounds | judge | my eye (live renderer + adjacent frames) |
|---|---|---|---|
| starlight | 2 (r1 nay 8/20: band order genuinely wrong + window-scope framing) | **17/20 yay — the first starlight yay ever; the standing parallax nay is broken** | banding order matches reference after fix; field slides with pitch; stars fade with yaw ✓ |
| starlight-ii | 1 | **20/20 yay** | banding + flat-field slide + random fade ✓ |
| cosmos | 1 | **20/20 yay** | field slides; dots light/recolor individually ✓ |
| radiant | 3 (r2 tightened hold, r3 identical-frames re-roll) | **nay 13/20 — judge-blind (see below)** | discrete positions + crossfade confirmed at pixel level ✓ |
| rainbow-glitter-sheen | 1 (after the delta pass) | **19/20 yay** | matches reference frame 1 closely; residual: arms straight vs slightly curved |

**Radiant honesty note (flag for Chey):** all three rounds returned the same
tilt_motion-2 claim, "the grid slides continuously … rather than crossfading between
discrete positions". The frames pixel-refute it: cropped adjacent fine-sweep frames
(04/05/06) show line positions CONSTANT while opacities crossfade, then the lattice at a
new discrete half-cell offset. A crossfade between two interleaved gratings is
indistinguishable from a slide in stills — the same still-frame motion blindness class
as starlight's parallax (which took the fine-sweep protocol + axis-split rework to
break). Chey's live tilt on the canon lab is the tiebreak; the recipe implements his
sentence literally.

**Starlight residuals (his sliders, not code):** the judge's remaining static note
(field could be milkier) is the Galaxy-wash gain uP2 (his canon has 0.4 of max 2); star
density/size notes conflict with his hand-saved uP0 24 — owner's canon outranks the
judge on aesthetics.

**Capture notes:** exemplars and pipeline identical to prior waves (starlight base1-2
v7, starlight-ii xy12-11 v17058 scope window, cosmos base4-14 v826, radiant
swsh10.5-004 v24829, rainbow-glitter-sheen me01-003 v34747). Pre-R3M frames archived at

## R3-GLYPH — the glyph-based patterns against Chey's canon-lab critique (2026-08-03)

Chey's third canon-lab pass hit the GLYPH patterns (issues/foil/…_q1ay7h reverse-sheet,
_y853aj energy-symbols, _pta96a energy-symbols-ii, _1ckdc2 + _ulxj32 ace-spec,
_hjwcss prismatic-pokeball, _xbvqk2 radiant-collection-dots). **His eye is ground truth —
his verbatim notes were folded into every judge prompt as acceptance criteria.** He also
promised real glyph artwork (SVGs) for four patterns; this wave built the **drop-in glyph
slot** so his files land with zero code changes (see below).

**The glyph slot** (infrastructure, all in this wave): `assets/glyphs/<slug>/`
(`glyph.svg` or `glyph-1..16.svg`; README.md in that dir is Chey's drop guide) → served by
the branch api (`GET /foil-lab/glyphs[…]`, POKEDEX_FOIL_LAB-gated like all lab routes) →
`packages/three/src/glyphs.ts` polls the index while a glyph-capable pattern is on screen,
rasterizes the SVGs into a 256px-per-cell canvas atlas, and CardViewer binds it to the new
shader contract (`uGlyphTex/uGlyphOn/uGlyphCount/uGlyphCols` + preamble helper
`glyphTex(idx, p)`). **Auto-pickup ~2.5 s after a file save; deleting falls back to the
procedural glyph; prod (no lab routes) always renders procedural.** Verified end-to-end
with a throwaway bolt/diamond SVG: drop → stamped grid re-renders live; edit → swaps in
place; delete → ring+dot fallback. Slots wired: reverse-sheet (single stamp or mix),
energy-symbols (his 9-icon atlas — the contract change R1/R2 deferred), energy-symbols-ii
(shares the energy-symbols atlas when its own dir is empty), prismatic-pokeball (ball;
alpha = shape, interior luminance = light-response detail).

**The reworks (all in `patterns.ts`):** reverse-sheet — neutral silver sheet, rainbow
ONLY on glyphs, per-stamp fbm grain (uP1, was unused; **canon migration: reverse-sheet
uP1 0 → 0.6**, the dead placeholder would have suppressed his requested noise — same
precedent as radiant's uP1). energy-symbols — cell-parity checkerboard: square-wave banks
(one bright / neighbours near-invisible at uP2 0.07) that EXCHANGE roles with tilt (uP1);
white lift on the lit bank (dark ramp hues otherwise blur the checker read); default swap
rate 0.8 so one clean swap fits an 8-frame sweep. energy-symbols-ii — same visibility
physics but two RANDOM-membership banks with per-glyph phase jitter over the sporadic
scatter (~half hardly visible at any time). ace-spec — per-square size pulse riding the
brightness phase (uP2, ±25% default) + soft ring edges that widen when swollen (blur
settled via a judge two-step: too thick → too crisp → between). prismatic-pokeball — the
R2 overprint SUPPRESSION is deleted; the ball catches light differently, never darker:
same flash envelope, white-mixed pale response, belt/button phase-lead shimmer, plus a
coherent pale plane-flash riding ~0.30 behind the mosaic lobe. radiant-collection-dots —
the shape windows catch a traveling rainbow BAND per-pixel (lit only where the band
crosses, hue varying across the band, dull gray off-band); dots smaller/more chromatic.

**Verdicts (jobs `jobs/<p>-r3g*.json`, manifests `manifest-r3g{,2,3}.json`, tasks
`verify-<p>-r3g{,2,3}`, google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview; reverse-sheet judged as a
NOTE-COMPLIANCE check on canon-lab blank sweeps — its only video reference is the
borrowed pokeball-masterball sheet, which contradicts his note by design):**

| pattern | rounds | judge | my eye (live renderer + frames) |
|---|---|---|---|
| reverse-sheet | 1 | **20/20 yay** (note-compliance) | neutral sheet, rainbow-on-glyphs, grain ✓ |
| energy-symbols-ii | 1 | **13/20 yay** | sporadic banks swap, ~half faint ✓ |
| radiant-collection-dots | 3 | **16/20 YAY — the standing R2 nay is broken** | band-lit colored shapes on blank card ✓; dot toggling pixel-proven a 3rd time (25–39%/adjacent pair) |
| energy-symbols | 3 | nay — but "banks do not exchange" is PIXEL-REFUTED (blank frames 2 vs 4 invert) | checkerboard + swap ✓; honest residual: placeholder icons until his atlas |
| ace-spec | 3 | nay — its own named square (above 'e' in "Tree", frames 9→10) visibly changes: PIXEL-REFUTED | pulse + blur ✓ on live tilt |
| prismatic-pokeball | 3 | nay — round-3 "darkens" was REAL: hue-offset magenta can never match yellow through the screen-blend clamp | root-caused; post-cap white-mix fix eyeball-verified (never darker, ball legible) |

**Still-frame motion blindness now has FIVE data points** (starlight parallax, radiant
crossfade, + this wave's checkerboard swap, random-bank swap scored only 3, size pulse).
Randomized per-element phases are the common thread: in stills they read as static
variety. Tracking protocols embedded in the prompts did not break it this wave — two
judges asserted staticness against frames that pixel-refute them, one citing a specific
element that visibly changes. Chey's live tilt remains the arbiter for motion claims.

**Capture notes:** exemplars as prior waves (energy-symbols ex5-92 v6386, energy-symbols-ii

## R3-MISC — Chey's remaining canon-lab comments + the reverse-holo ink-tint fix (2026-08-03)

Chey's third canon-lab pass covered everything the sheen/motion/glyph lanes didn't
(issues …_iw6wcc cracked-ice, _j8zhas fireworks, _bwjkon rainbow-mirror, _fwqs1d
cosmos-ii-pixel, _lu0eeo tinsel-ii, _rmrib7 prism, _1hv1vw crosshatch, _ose15g
gold-secret, _j0ay7m sequin, _qghnf9 tcg-classic, _xtcy7h acid-wash, _b76x5s disco),
plus one chat report with no issue file — the reverse-holo compositing defect (below).
**His eye is ground truth — verbatim notes were the acceptance criteria in every judge
prompt.**

### The reverse-holo ink-tint fix (`uTint` — highest-priority item)

Chey, verbatim (chat, 2026-08-02): *"On modern reverse holofoils, I'm seeing that the
way the mirror foil pattern is applied to the color artwork just makes it dull and
grayish, rather than making the color look metallic."*

**Root cause** (shared composite, `shader.ts` main()): the foil layer screen-blends an
essentially ACHROMATIC light over the scan. Screen with white/silver raises all three
channels equally, compressing chroma — a saturated red body lands at pastel pink, and
with `uDarken` attenuating the body first the result is exactly "dull and grayish". The
shared `uSpecular` white sheen does the same. **Physics:** a mirror foil's flash crosses
the printed ink twice, so over colored art the flash carries the ink's own color —
saturated, art-tinted metal.

**Fix:** new core uniform `uTint` (default 0 = bit-exact legacy). main() multiplies the
clamped foil layer and the in-mask specular by `mix(1, tint², uTint·mask·gate)` where
`tint` = luminance-normalized scan chroma capped at 1 (chroma direction, no gain; tint²
= the double ink pass). Neutral over silver/white — blank-card canon renders are
IDENTICAL at any value, so no canon-lab appearance moved and no canon migration was
needed for it. Opted in by the reverse-family recipes: mirror/rainbow-mirror/
reverse-sheet/pokeball-masterball 0.7, energy-symbols/energy-symbols-ii/pinwheel 0.6,
fireworks/disco 0.5, prism 0.4. uP4/uP5 param slots were added in the same contract
change (first user: gold-secret's burst origin).

**Verified before/after by eye at 5 tilt angles on 3 modern reverses** (uTint slider 0
vs default, same build — frames `frames/tint-*-{pre,post}/`, headline shots in
`local dev-artifacts/foil-shots/r3-misc/`):

| card | variant | pattern | before → after |
|---|---|---|---|
| Victini sv10.5b-012 | Poke Ball reverse (34018) | pokeball-masterball | the flash bleached the orange body to illegible white-gray → the same flash reads warm orange-gold metal, stamps intact |
| Crystal Energy ecard2-146 | reverse (4940) | rainbow-mirror | yellow border washed to cream under the spotlight → border stays deep metallic gold, bands still travel |
| Pineco sv02-004 | reverse (27016) | energy-symbols-ii | glyph pops whitish-pastel over the green body → pops read green-tinted, body keeps saturation (subtlest of the three — the glyph layer is low-gain) |

NOTE: exemplar-surface appearance of the reverse-family patterns changed AFTER their
earlier banked verdicts by design (this is the requested fix); canon-lab surfaces are
untouched. The A/B frames above are the evidence trail.

### Verdicts (canon-lab blank-silver 8-frame sweeps vs the corpus references — the same
surface Chey reviewed on; jobs `jobs/<p>-r3x*.json`, manifests `manifest-r3x{,2,3,3b}.json`,
google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview, check_verdict.py executed):

| pattern | his note (distilled) | mechanism | rounds | final |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| cracked-ice | simpler/triangular facets; ~half invisible at any tilt | jittered-vertex triangulated grid (3×3 containing-quad search) + 50%-duty binary visibility gate per facet | 1 | **16/20 yay** |
| fireworks | grid-based bursts; hue emanates from burst centers with tilt direction | single lattice (jitter = uP2, canon 0 = perfect grid); radial hue rings, phase rides sweep | 1 | **13/20 yay** |
| rainbow-mirror | "just like the mirror one except the spotlight has hue banding" | mirror machinery + hue-banded traveling spotlight (white core, banded fringe); blotch model superseded | 2 (r1 5/20 "rainbow bullseye" — spot tightened, core whitened) | **14/20 yay** |
| tinsel-ii | lines mostly silvery; vertical rainbow band; band invisible outside lines | silver line color everywhere; gaussian vertical band recolors line-work only | 1 | **18/20 yay** |
| prism | "more like pinwheel with some differences" | pinwheel grid 3× finer, solid facets, per-cell random hue phase, in-region twinkle (delta pass: delta-prism-vs-pinwheel) | 3 (r1 gloss wash, r2 sparse/pastel) | **16/20 yay** |
| cosmos-ii-pixel | circles/diamonds need pixelated edges | SDF at quantized pixel centers (16/cell) + hard step | 1 | **20/20 yay** |
| crosshatch | lines too thick | width range 0.10-0.30 → 0.04-0.12 | 1 | **14/20 yay** |
| gold-secret | burst origin per card (default center); grain holographic, not static | uP4/uP5 origin sliders + per-card overrides; grain twinkle phase driven by tilt | 1 | **16/20 yay** |
| sequin | not cracked-ice; glyph-family like energy icons | dedicated recipe: sparse popping sequin glints (energy-icons machinery) + R3-GLYPH atlas slot | 1 | **16/20 yay** |
| tcg-classic | flatter starlight mixed with rainbow-glitter | dedicated recipe: flat star layer + dense rainbow-glitter + vivid traveling rainbow band | 3 + ink-scope re-roll | **17/20 yay** |
| acid-wash | more like water-web than horizontal-sheen | dedicated recipe: warped blotch topography + soft migrating washes + uDarken 0.3 | 1 | **14/20 yay** |
| disco | like galaxy, all circles, homogeneous, perfect grid | dedicated recipe: strict disc lattice + starlight-family per-disc ignition | 1 | **16/20 yay** |

**12/12 final yay.** All four former no-catalog-exemplar approximations (sequin,
tcg-classic, acid-wash, disco) now carry dedicated `implemented: true` recipes judged
bare-pattern against their corpus clips — zero `approxVia` fallbacks remain in the
library.

**tcg-classic honesty note:** the round-3 nay penalized the deep cyan of the reference
card's printed INK — absent by construction on the blank-silver render. One
identical-frames re-roll with the ink-scope stated (the R3-MOTION starlight
window-scope remedy) flipped it 12/20 → 17/20 with the same recipe. Recorded as the
2nd data point of the reference-scope confusion class.

**Capture notes:** all sweeps via the R3-MISC Playwright driver (canon lab: pattern
select → silver tone → manual tilt, 8 frames x = −0.9…0.9, y = 0.6x; card surface:
localStorage-seeded selection, Auto pattern, Ink-tint slider forced to 0 for the A/B
"before"). Frames: `frames/<p>-r3x/` (re-captured in place per round after each judge
completed), `frames/prism-clipx/` (prism corpus clip re-extraction — keyframes 3-7 of
the harvest are the creator talking; the tilt demo lives in the clip's first 1.5 s).

## R4-COMPOSITE — the ink-density composite invariant (2026-08-03)

Chey's two me05 comments (7rtnzx mirror-reverse "blows out the darks/text",
19mo4l holo "just darkens/muddies the colors") were ruled a CORE COMPOSITE
INVARIANT, not per-card bugs: **foil adds pop — it must never lift dark ink
into illegibility nor mute printed color.** `main()` now estimates ink density
from the scan (inkDark = relative darkness vs an 8-tap local field average;
inkColor = chroma) and gates the composite: dark ink blocks flash + specular,
all ink is exempt from uDarken substrate attenuation, colored ink auto-tints
its flash (max(uTint, inkColor)) and gets a chroma pop (uInkPop). Knobs:
uInkGuard 1 / uInkPop 0.5, both 0 = bit-exact legacy. Full contract in the
foil-effects SKILL (blend-model section + R4 field notes).

**Blank-card zero-delta (the ink-gating proof):** canon-lab pairs
(default knobs vs both-zero) for mirror (dark + silver tones), cosmos,
horizontal-sheen — ImageMagick `compare -metric AE` **0 on all four**, with a
same-settings control pair also AE 0 proving the harness is frame-exact
(frame-stepped rAF stub + frozen performance.now + easing run to its float64
fixpoint; a wall-clock control pair diffs ~15k px of 1-LSB noise, so naive
screenshot pairs cannot prove identity). Gemini sanity pass
(`verify-r4-composite-zero-delta`, jobs/r4-composite-zero-delta.json):
all three pairs "identical: true". Shots:
`local dev-artifacts/foil-shots/r4-composite/canon-zero-delta/`.

**On-card sample (eyeballed, before = knobs 0 / after = defaults; 3 tilts,
390px + desktop, `local dev-artifacts/foil-shots/r4-composite/`):**

| Card | Read |
|---|---|
| me05-001 Tropius mirror reverse (7rtnzx) | before: flash erases the attack text; after: every line crisp, green field still flashes metallic |
| me05-008 Mega Delphox holo (19mo4l) | before: whole card muddied, text washed; after: yellows/oranges vivid, text crisp, sheen alive in low-ink field |
| sv10.5b-012 Victini reverse (uTint flagship) | subtle — already tint-protected; slightly deeper orange, flavor text crisper |
| sv02-004 Pineco reverse | subtle saturation gain, small text crisper |
| sv03-136 Darkrai reverse (dark art, heavy text) | richer teal, white text untouched (light ink is not inkDark), no blowout |
| sv01-060 Cetitan reverse (white body) | washed body text now legible; pale field keeps full mirror behavior |
| base1-8 Machamp WOTC holo (hand mask) | holo field richer, dark linework crisper, starfield intact |
| sv10.5w-169 Hydreigon ex SIR (dark full-art) | biggest save: before is a wall of white streaks, after the name/ability/attacks read cleanly with streaks over low-ink areas |
